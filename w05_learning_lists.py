#Using square brakets we can create lists in python [ ] 

clients = []
clients = ["John", "Mary"]
clients = list()

#Can't use the word "list" as a variable because it's a keyword
#Considered good practice to use plural word for variable chose for list name i.e. clients not client; players not player

#To add new clients to the list we use append method.

clients = ["John", "Mary"]
print(clients)
clients.append("Lucas")
clients.append("Lisa")
print()
print(clients)

#Checking this part still
clientes.append(input("What's your client's name?: ")
print()
print(clients)
